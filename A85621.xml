            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Great and Terrible PLOT Diſcovered in the NORTH.</head>
            <p>SInce the arrivall of the laſt Poſt from the North, which intimated unto us the unhappy tydings of the great Conſpiracy in the North of England, yet welcome Newes, in the timely diſcovery of it; we are further advertiſed, and it is likewiſe ſignified to the honourable houſes of Parliament, by letters from very good hands, the dangerous proceedings of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts in thoſe Parts; wherein is made manifeſt, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate malice, and moſt bloody deſignes of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of England; For, having formerly been the chiefe Inſtruments of involving this Kingdome in bloud, by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:160074:3"/>engaging a deſperate warre againſt the VVorthies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, have (ſince the happy ſheathing of this devouring ſword) again endeavoured to draw it, that ſo ſtreames of bloud might iſſue forth, and run down the ſtreets of our ſtately Townes and Cities: But God forbid, for Hee having by His omnipotent Power ſheathed the ſword, and compoſed the ſad difference and diſtractions within this bleeding Kingdome, were now pleaſed to manger their Deſignes, and being to light the wicked Conſpiracies and Intentions of the Enemies to Truth and Peace; as will manifeſtly appeare by this enſuing Relation.</p>
            <p>The Royaliſts in the North of England, having for many weekes together laboured and endeavoured with his Majeſty for the raiſing of Forces, and providing of Armes, and other Neceſſaries of warre, having attained their deſires, began to pluck up their drooping Spirits, and to appear in a warlike maner, divers of them having obtained new Commiſſion from his Majeſty to raiſe Forces againſt the Parliament; and thoſe which have bin in Armes againſt the Parliament for the King, flock thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and promiſes are made that they ſhall have conſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the time they ſpend, till they become uſefull, and can attain to the accompliſhing of their Deſignes in agitation, by raiſing of an Army to oppoſe the Power and Strength of his Excellency ſir <hi>Tho. Fairfax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Names of the chief Ringleaders which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Commiſſions from his Majeſty, are, ſir Marmaduke Darcy, ſir Iordan Croſland, ſir William Blackſton, and many others: But now they begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire by reaſon that their main ſupportance, and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt aymes hath taken no effect, which was, the ſurpiſall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160074:3"/>of the ſtrong Holds and Garriſons in the North (now in poſſeſſion of the Parliaments Forcces) the Names of which, together with the manner of the Scituation of them, I will faithfully communicate, as followeth:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that impregnable Hold the Caſtle of Ponte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fract, who endured more then a yeares ſiege by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Forces, under the Command of the right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable the Lord Fairfax; which place if it had beene again re-poſſeſs't by the enemy, (as was intended) would have coſt many thouſand mens lives, before the retaking of it.</p>
            <p>But that which makes us moſt lament, it, that the concord and union of our diſtreſsed Kingdome ſhould ſtill be retarded and meet with oppoſition; for it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated unto us, that for the ſurpriſall of the ſorenamed Gariſon, the Kings hand &amp; ſeale was not onely ſhewed but that his Majeſty had alſo granted ſeverall Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to men of eminency, for the further proſecuting of the Deſign in agitation againſt the Parliament, as is before cited.</p>
            <p>But if this Plot had taken effect, our renowned Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had loſt one of the chiefeſt Flowers in this little Garden; for, it is held to be one of the ſtrongeſt Caſtles in Europe, having ten great Towres within it, and ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated upon a high Rock, having but two Gates to enter in at, and the walls at leaſt ſeven or eight yards in breadth, being free from Battery by any Canon.</p>
            <p>If the enemy had become Maſters of this Caſtle, they would have indangered moſt of the other Holds in the North, as Scarbrough, a place of great conſequence, and ſcituated upon a a mighty high Rock, which if once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repoſsest of again, would tend much to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160074:4"/>of this Kingdome, but eſpecially to the Northerne Counties.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Caſtle of Helmsley would have beene in great danger, by reaſon of the innumerable ſort of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Malignants that are about it, it is a place of great concernment, having coſt many mens lives in the reducing of it, and much bloud ſpilt in the attempting thereof.</p>
            <p>His Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax at his beſieging of the ſaid place received a terrible wound, being ſhot through the ſhoulder with a ſling-bullet, weighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven or eight pound, as he was viewing the ground for raiſing of his Batteries, and planting of his Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>But to conclude, Skipton Caſtle, Knaresbrough Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and Sandall Caſtle is ſuppoſed would bee alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagered, being places of great ſtrength and conſequence, eſpecially the two firſt.</p>
            <p>All which (is very probable) would have heene at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, if they had proſpered in their firſt Deſigne; but being fruſtrated in that, and many of the Complot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters apprehended, the reſt deſpaire (as men out of hopes) betaking themſelves to any corners or holes for ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the Royailſts that have had formerly ſo many frequent meetings, and divers others of the Kings Officers and Souldiers, that lay hovering up and downe the Northern Parts, plundering and pillaging the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, dare not appear ſo publikely, nor appoint meetings as formerly.</p>
            <p>So that it is hoped all their wicked ſtratagems and Conſpiracies will ſoone bee fruſtrated, by reaſon of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160074:4"/>The confident expectations we have of a firm union betwixt the two Kingdoms of England and Scotland, will (we hope) in a very ſhort time remove all fears and jealouſies (magure the malice of the adverſary.) The receipt of the money is conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto; for ſo far are we from ſtanding on punctillioes, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which might retard matters of greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it will appear to the world that we ſhall be moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in our performances; in purſuance whereof, the Scots ſhall receive the firſt 100000. l. at North-Otherton, and when they are marched out of Newcaſtle the other 100000. l. accepting of Hoſtages for the rendition of the reſt of our Gariſons, and their quitting the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot to intimate unto you, that the Scots Commiſſioners ſent a Letter to the Houſe, of the tranſactions of the treaty between them and our Commiſſioners, about the matters before recited, and are pleaſed to declare, that its far from their deſire, that any differences or miſunderſtandings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe betwixt us. We hear that a faire concluſion will be made to the generall ſatisfaction of all good men, and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Peace betwixt the two Kingdomes. The money is ſpeedily to be ſent away, And his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax is to ſend a ſtrong party of horſe, conſiſting of 3000. for the ſafe conveighing of it to the North.</p>
            <p>The Parliament have alſo been pleaſed to expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, concerning the Covenant, as followeth:</p>
            <p>We by the Covenant in the firſt Article which concerns Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>are to endeavour in our ſeverall Places and Callings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond, which concerns the extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, Superſtition, Hereſie, Schiſm and prophaneneſſe, <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in like manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the third, which concerns the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament, the Liberties of the Kingdoms, and the preſervation and defence of the true Religion and liberties of the Kingdoms and the preſervation and defence of the Kings perſon and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion &amp; Liberties of the Kingdoms, <hi>to indeavour in our ſeverall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 4. which concerns Incendiaries they are to be brought
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160074:5"/>to publike tryall, and receive condign puniſhment from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Judicatories of <hi>both Kingdoms reſpectively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fifth concerning the continuing of the peace &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kingdom of England and Scotland, We <hi>ſhall each out of us endeavour according to our Places and Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſixth and laſt, concerning the aſſiſtance and defence of all thoſe that enter into this Covenant. <hi>To indeavour according to our Places and Callings,</hi> to perform whatſoever we are oblie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to by the Covenant.</p>
            <p>It ſeems ſtrange to us, That England and Scotland being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall diſtinct Kingdoms, and by Covenant each one being to act in his <hi>ſeverall Place, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ocation Call ng and Intereſt,</hi> that the Kingdom of Scotland ſhould from the Covenant entitle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the right of exerciſing any joynt power in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of England the expreſſe words of the Covenant being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the exerciſe of any joynt power, which was <hi>ſeveral and diſtinct</hi> before the making this Covenant, and the joynt exerciſe of ſuch power would break the Covenant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are thereby obliged in our <hi>ſeveral <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ocations,</hi> mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preſerve the Rights and Priviledges of the Parliaments, &amp; the Liberties of the Kingdoms, and the exerciſe of ſuch a joynt power, which doth give a negative voyce to another Nation, in the proceedings in the Kingdoms of England &amp; Ireland would be a manifeſt breach of thoſe priviledges and liberties: And whereas throughout your whole Papers this joynt intereſt is ſo much inforced from the Covenant, neither that word <hi>Ioyatly,</hi> nor any other expreſsion which will bear that interpretation, is ſo much as mentioned in the Covenant; and the words, each one in his ſeverall Vocation, Calling Place and Intereſt, which runs through the whole Covenant, and would have cleared the meaning of it are wholly left out by you and in all your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citals of the Covenant, or arguments drawn from thence, there are no words to that effect.</p>
